We are thrilled to announce the general availability of the new [**Effect
Playground**](https://effect.website/play), an interactive coding environment
embedded directly into Effect's website!

Designed from the ground up with experimentation and exploration in mind, the
Effect Playground offers a seamless way to delve into all the features that
Effect has to offer!

## Key Features

### Powerful Code Editor

The Effect Playground comes with a fully-featured Monaco editor that runs the
latest version of TypeScript. Because Effect leverages TypeScript to the
fullest, this ensures you have access to all the latest bug fixes and features
being incorporated into the TypeScript language.

The editor includes:

- IntelliSense for code completion and auto-import suggestions
- Real-time error checking and inline feedback
- Syntax highlighting and formatting

The file explorer displays your playground's files in a structured tree format.

Functionality is provided for adding, removing, or renaming files, which can be
useful when writing larger code snippets.

In addition, editing the `dprint.json` or `tsconfig.json` will update the
editor's formatting and TypeScript configurations, respectively, in real-time.

The playground also has an integrated terminal environment which can be used to
install additional dependencies via `pnpm`, run arbitrary scripts and commands,
or inspect the file system to see the build output of your program.

### Shareable Code Snippets

The Effect Playground makes it super simple to create shareable links to your
playground code. This is perfect for quickly sharing snippets with friends, or
for providing issue reproductions to the core Effect maintainers, all without
needing to clone or install anything locally.

Just generate a link and share it!

### Effect DevTools Integration

One of the standout features of Effect is how simple it is to get started with
collecting, processing, and exporting [telemetry data](https://effect.website/docs/guides/observability/telemetry)
from your Effect programs.

With just a simple call to `Effect.withSpan`, Effect can start providing you
with critical insights into the performance and behavior of your application.

This is precisely why we decided to integrate the Effect Playground with the
Effect DevTools. By doing so, we aim to help developers understand just how easy
it can be to instrument applications with Effect and see first-hand how useful
this telemetry data can be.

With the integrated trace viewer, you can visualize application traces coming
from the playground in real-time.

Clicking on a span will allow you to inspect that span's attributes and events.

Spans containing errors are also highlighted to simplify tracing the path of
errors within your Effect programs.
